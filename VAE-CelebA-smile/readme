The attached code uses latent space arithmetic to modify celebrity faces to smile more or smile less on CelebA dataset 

Architecture: Variational Autoencoder
Dataset: CelebA
Layers: Conv2d and ConvTranspose2d

Latent space arithmetic: 
    Diff = Average of smiling - Average of non-smiling
    Modified image = Original image + diff
